Navigate to your cockatrice files (easiest way is to select the "Card Database" drop down menu in cockatrice and choose "Open Custom Sets Folder")

Place tumbled-mtg-cards.xml in data/customsets

If your TumbledMTG build is JUST for TumbledMTG, place tokens.xml in data

If your TumbledMTG build is mixed with other MTG sets, place tbld-tokens.xml in Cockatrice/data/customsets

Drag all the images from NEW IMAGES into data\pics\CUSTOM

Done!
