Navigate to your cockatrice files (easiest way is to select the "Card Database" drop down menu in cockatrice and choose "Open Custom Sets Folder")

Place the two XML files in Cockatrice/data/customsets

Delete any old TumbledMTG card files and the old TumbledMTG token files. Place the new text files in Cockatrice/data/customsets

Done!
